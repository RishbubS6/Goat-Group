# GitHub Pages Intro

Welcome — this is a lightweight introduction page for GitHub Pages.

This page replaces a broken notebook-based page and ensures the URL
`/github/pages/intro` resolves correctly.

## Quick Tips

- Put site pages under the repository root or a folder Jekyll will process.
- Use YAML front matter (as above) so Jekyll will build the page.

## A small joke to keep things light

Why did the programmer quit his job? Because he didn't get arrays!

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because the light attracts bugs!

"What computer sings the best? A Dell!

Enjoy exploring GitHub Pages.
